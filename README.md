# CS-Boss-Monster
A basic console game where the player battles a monster by choosing to Attack or Heal. The game continues until either the monster or the player is defeated.

Game Play
The player starts with a set amount of health (HP) and has options to Attack or Heal.
Healing has a cooldown period after each use.
The monster attacks after each player action.
Attacks and heals have random values within specified ranges.
The game ends when either the monster's or player's HP drops to zero or below.
Players are given the option to play again after each game ends.
Requirements
Players choose actions by typing "Attack" or "Heal".
When attacking, the player's attack amount is randomly determined between the player's minimum and maximum attack values.
When healing, the heal amount is randomly determined between the player's minimum and maximum heal values. A cooldown period prevents immediate consecutive heals.
The monster's attack amount is randomly determined between the monster's minimum and maximum attack values after each player action.
